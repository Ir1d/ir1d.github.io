I'm Dejia Xu and I'm now a senior undergraduate student majoring Computer Science at School of Electronic Engineering and Computer Science in Peking University, advised by Prof. [Boxin Shi](http://ci.idm.pku.edu.cn/).

My primary interests lie in image restoration from severe weather conditions or artificial defects in an efficient and robust way, benefiting downstream high-level tasks as well.

I will apply for master programs starting from 2020 fall. Simultaneously, I am enthusiastic in exploring and expanding my career for the next half year. Please contact me if you are interested. [CV](https://github.com/Ir1d/ir1d.github.io/blob/master/DejiaXu.pdf)
